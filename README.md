# [KNOWL3DG3 CONTAINERS](https://knowledge-front-end-1366ec6c3d29.herokuapp.com/) 

## [Front-End](https://github.com/bono-94/Project-5-Advanced-Front-End-Code-Institute) 

## INTRODUCTION

## Project Description

platform, and browser-based interface that allows users to create, view, edit, interact with, and delete knowledge placements and their' belonging containers. Any post while being created can be placed inside multiple containers which can help organize and categorize all content. It has been designed for its users to share their life's wisdom and experiences concisely, empowering, teaching, and inspiring the audience. All knowledge posts have their own pre-selected types ranging from ideas, stories, tutorials, journals, events, and many more. The entire application consists of the React app which is the front-end and an API app which is the back-end. Application Programming Interface (API) is created for the consumption of data by front-end applications, allowing users to allow users to store and manipulate data records. This solution is created for the purpose of public exposure to real-life global audiences, sharing and publishing global knowledge for common progress benefit. The advantage of the creation of any posts on this platform is to allow users to choose which information is important and relevant to be properly represented and presented online in range of large quantity of options. Besides creating posts, users and authors can also create entire containers, edit their visually appealing user profiles, or even send support requests. Whether you're an individual looking to share your expertise or a team collaborating on various projects, this platform offers a range of features and capabilities to meet any of your unique needs. In addition, we are your perfect partner if you aspire to make a meaningful impact around the globe through the convenience of the digital world. By creating posts and containers through this project, the user is the master owner of the information that truly matters and that will be used as a foundation for future projects, products, and services. Once payment methods are enrolled in v2.0, each knowledge purchase and sale will be given a percentage to charity as a donation, introducing the "learn-to-earn" and "teach-to-earn".

## Project Purpose:

Due to the current global focus on individual benefits, the world needs a single meeting point for collective collaborative progress. Therefore this project is created in order to emphasize more day-to-day importance of knowledge units and bridging all aspects of human civilization life. The purpose of the Knowl3dg3 Containers project is to provide a fully built content-sharing web application with React and an API (Django Rest Framework) Back-End allowing users to enjoy interactive and content-based experiences. The platform should represent our vibrant community, with the possibility of getting involved with a versatile publishing tool. Users should have various options such as tools to create, view, edit, interact with, and delete content. The project aims to facilitate and inspire users to share their life's wisdom and experiences concisely while promoting inclusion, education, and excellence. The mission is to provide a global stage for sharing and publishing knowledge to benefit everyone on the planet. From a structural point of view, all data should be presented in a way that makes it easy for users to find what they're looking for. With UX Design in mind, the purpose has not been visually displayed to the user, instead, it is self-evident and implied. This project was started as a solution for a specific real-life business enterprise. The development team was contracted to create this first as the client's internal team training tool and product/service they can sell on the market. After multiple meetings to capture their vision, the need for specific custom solutions has only increased and the project was accepted. There was no limitation for the budget in terms of (financial) resources or time. Due to the NDA agreement and legal protection of the client's intellectual property, in the public version of README nothing further is allowed to be discussed. 

## Project Goals:

- GOAL 1: Develop concepts and features for an online community dedicated to global collaboration progress

- GOAL 2: Create a project that combines individually running, self-containing back-end and front-end

- GOAL 3: Allow CRUD functionalities for user-data interaction

- GOAL 4: Create a project that allows users to connect related or unrelated theories or topics

- GOAL 5: Create a safe, inclusive and healthy environment where user can share their life wisdom and experiences

### Alerts

  - Alerts are informing user of changes within their data if there was an error or success
  - Success alerts are positioned on the home page in order to give user consistent experience and one page break from previous task and let them re-calibrate before proceeding either to public containers after creating knowledge, or maybe even editing name of the container after creating new knowledge post
  - This is the reason all success alerts take user to the home page that is purposely designed around this rule where user does not want to see every time they do something welcome media or video. They need simple welcome board with quick decision to make out of 2 boxes
  - Success alerts come from created, edited or deleted knowledge posts, containers, profile or support
  - Each alert has black background and orange font to support other navigational constant static components
  - Each alert has timeout of 8 seconds to give even slow readers chance to read with optional close button for fast readers
  
  - Warning Alerts are lighter shade of orange that is content-related color 
  - Displays interactive and closeable message to users triggered by custom conditions such as which issues user has encountered and how solve it
  - Simple alert box streatches most of the width of the form in order to completely separate itself from success messages deliberately not being green. It also alsows users to immediately identify which field has an issue without possibilities overlooking and scrolling the form once it starts scaling-up

### Home

  - First point of actual content interaction with users visiting application
  - Provides brief overview and sets expectations
  - It captures immediately attention of the user with the unique design
  - It allows them to navigate further and read more about the website and concept before proceeding to main content
  - Text had to be concise with only useful general information taking into consideration global audience with different characteristics
  - It helps building brand and relate to users better
  - No landing media due to often returning to the index, especially for all alerts to prevent oversaturation with same landing media
  - User is able to view 3 separate sections:
    - Welcome message in the orange (content-focused) container with introduction to the platform
      - fits tight on small screens and has a lot of spacing around in larger screens per clients decision on our request for preference
      - keeps the largest font title on the page to establish the header feeling without hero image
      - no further media being technology-focused website in v2.0
    - Decision cards where 2 main features of the website are described: containers & knowledge
      - Second point of user interaction
      - Divides visually content into 2 directions
      - Provides specifics on the each direction and what users can expect there
      - If user is logged in they can see buttons to take them to those sections
      - If user is logged out, they cannot see navigational buttons to main sections since they do not have access to those or navbar icons
      - Both cards were styled in black background(navigational) with content being orange font to contrast the welcome card above
      - All titles with belonging icons are colored white for sharp output and not being fused into orange content below
      - Both cards contain introduction to the main categories with their types and benefits for the users
      - On mobile and tablet screens, both cards are placed above each other for readibility purpose with navigation buttons centered taking almost entire width of the card
      - On larger screens than that, due to more space, cards are placed next to each other for comparison and easier decision making and to prevent too much scrolling. 
      - Navigation button now takes less than 50% of the card width aligned all the way to the right under the benefits, having name on the button "Select" so it makes it seem like user is "selecting" benefits named above it
      - Font-sizes are fully responsive to any screen size accordingly
      - Icons always take their row without fusing with title in orded to prevent same look as navigation bar and further distinction of content
    - Support information section
      - It contains 3 sections: Introduction message by customer support, 24/7 support information, and community forum information
      - Entire support section being the last on the home page and closest to the footer and content-focused is being styled with orange background and black font
      - The titles of sub-sections are much larger than their content for clear distinction of content
      - On mobile devices and tablets, all sub-sections are structured under each other
      - On larger screens main message is always above the 2 other sub-sections being next to each other showing they are 2 possibilites of introduction message with a lot of padding around all 3 sections centered inside it not having to stretch all the content across the entire large PC monitor for example
      - Both 24/7 Support and Community Forum icons are black as content but on hover turning white to indicate it is a link also
      - 24/7 Support takes user immeditely to Support page, while Community Forum takes user to list of all posts where they can choose one and interact with community live on the comments

### Support

  - Support page is the most important component for website's customer experience
  - It creates UX effect of constantly being there for the user assuring confidence and solutions to any doubts
  - Only users with account can access the support page. If not user and manually types /support to the URL link, user gets pushed to the home page
    - Prevention of form abuse and easier identifier of who tried to overload the page with infinite support requests
  - It also allows automatic identification of request owner without having to enter personal information every time
  - Users can first identify type of support they need having options from:
    - Consultancy - book a session with one of the experts on content topic or technological advisor
    - Feedback - give personal opinion to the website about design, features quality and experience as user
    - Request Knowledge - ask the portal to source specific knowledge for your containers
    - Support Ticket - report any problems, issues, concerns and more...
    - Suggestion - offer any advices, tips and ideas for improving the website or content in any way possible
  - Users are then asked to give a title to their request to reach correct department next to writing the full content of the Support Form in textarea offering large quantity of input words and readibility
  - Finally, at the end user can indicate which exact knowledge post or container is the form support about
  - Additional benefit of the form is that it can serve as flexible solutions to any break in smooth user experience
  - Without the proper always available support user would be demotivated pretty quickly once they encounter the UX "wall"
  - This way we covered any possible additional feature and inconsistency that user might even personally expect and offer alternative to inform us about it so we can add functionality for them if necessary
  - Form also can serve as re-population of containers per individual knowledge. Since user can only select containers when creating knowledge but not in editing form, they are advised to contact support when they want to append or remove containers. This creates overall more trusteable content preventing abuse and constant changes and misinformation having all content modification going first through admins and support team for approval.
  - Form is fully responsive and following identical styling as all other forms on this page for smooth user experience and website consistency with strategic development and UX design intent.

### Public Profiles List

 - Component that occurs the most on other pages next to knowledge posts
 - It serves the purpose of constantly allowing users second choice or second direction besides main scrolleable content. For example if user is scrolling posts for long time and opens interesting one, it will show details and comments and user would have nowhere to go "next". Only back. For that reason this component always gives alternative scrolling profile, knowledge or containers page to go and visit someone else's work
 - The component consists of title, sort icon, search bar and profiles
 - Sort icon on clicks creates dropdown list of all potential sorting combinations, ascending and descending both on age, location, knowledge count, containers count, followers count, date joined
 - Search bar allows user to find profiles matching their input value being for username, first name, contents of profile quote and bio summary, exact age, location or website
 - On mobile and tablet devices output is slightly different than on larger devices being positioned under the nav bar, centered and taking most of width of a screen. It also only displays 3 profiles at the time only with profile image and username
 - On larger screens than that, everything is identical besides positioning of course of the component always found on the right side of the screen taking full height of the screen but only under 33% of the screen of width. In addition to picture and username, additional values are shown such as location, age, posts and conteiners count, followers count and date joined. There is no limitation of only 3 profiles. Now profiles became infinite scroll
 - Sort icon is colored black by default being navigational focused but on click when dropdown opens it turns orange since user is now not in navigation mode anymore, but content-searching by reading over possible sorting possibilities
 - Search bar has by default border orange to mark area on the screen where user can search for content, no pun intended. Once input field is in focus and user is typing, entire input field turns orange by user now explicitly dealing with content only
 - User can click on any public profile's image which will automatically take user to that public profile

### Profile Details Page

  - Profile Details Page as name indicates, is detailed overview of user or any other public user's information and post activity
  - The page is built from 3 components: User's details, all user's posts ordered by most recent and Public Profiles List
  - Public Profiles List is there to allow users to find and open next profile. 
  - Profile's Posts are full individual post cards maped through infinite-scroll that show list of all posts created by relevant user. On all screens they are located below User's details card
  - User's details card is almost identical in terms of public profiles vs. owner=logged in user. The only difference is that when user is looking at its' own profile they are presented with additional functionality. There is a three dot icon when clicked on it activates dropdown box with navigation links with icons allowing user to go to Edit Profile page, Change Username or Change password
  - For all profiles now, user can see card with other users or own details with black sleek background and orange sharp contrast reserved to emphasise content being content-related color. White color on black background, the same as on home page represents categorization of content.
  - All the details are filling up as user edits their newly created profile.
    - Without any action, they will be able to see the classic edit dropdown button, user image, username since it is hard requierement for creating account and 4 counters with starting value of 0 for following, followers, knowledge and containers
    - With action taken on all fields, specific ones if desired, user can also show/see the profile's first_name, profile page quote, current location, age, short bio and one website link to social media or personal page
  - User image is 3D Artificial Intelligence type of human face design with triangle image which is placeholder for all accounts with associated image that user can associate with but still logically conclude through high-end artwork that it is public default image. In addition, the profile picture emmits orange box-shadow glow adding modern feeling to it and there is a minimum border in case user submits an image with identical background color to the container color
  - User's username is largest font on the card for viewer to be able to immediately who is the owner of the profile without having to look at the image. Under the username as title, first name of user can be showed as sub-title with smaller font if filled in. Both of them are centered it terms of the entire belonging container width.
  - Every user has 4 counters associated with their profile that count how many other users is user of profile following, how many are following user of profile, next to how many knowl3dg3 posts and containers has user of profile created since joining. Counter content is orange as content-related color and white font color is for categorization and readibility. All counters update on interaction or refresh
  - Profile quote can be left by user on their public profile where other user can read their motivation, fun fact, or any other eye-catching content completely isolated by line dividers and italic font offering a true feeling of a quotation. Being content-focused, it is colored orange
  - User can also add to their profile supporting context disclosure for example to know if opinion about italian cuisine is coming from Italy or somewhere unrelated, or if user has high age would in most of cases have a lot of wisdom and already created knowledge from before, while younger user would be expected to produce content more oftern about most recent events. Also bio can tell about user as an author and their story
  - At the bottom of the User detail card, if filled, there can be a link displayed to any social media or personal page of an user that on click opens in a new tab
  - All content fields are grouped by strategic empty space or by separating lines and positioned in different and specific way based on screen size.
    - Edit profile dropdown icon is always in the top right corner of a card
    - Profile image is on the mobile and tablet screens above all content centered horizontally in the middle
    - On larger screens, profile image becomes under 50% width of card screen while the rest of the content is on the right sice of it
    - The rest of the content is mostly taking single row per single field besides the counter. on mobile devices, counter is in matrix shape making left side relevant to following users, while right side is for counting content. On tablet and larger screens, the counter takes all 4 counters in the same row

### Containers Landing Page 

  - Special page designed to inform users more about containers while improving user experience
  - Since the knowledge post name is self-explanatory, the user might wonder what are containers. In this scenario, the page  offers 3 sections where the user can find out more
  - The first section on the top is with a large title telling the user what containers in their core do. Under the title, there is a short introduction motivating the user to click on the button to create their own containers.
  - In the second section there are 2 flipping cards, one representing public and the other one private containers. These are 2 main categories of containers. On mobile, they are on top of each other and on larger screens next to each other. On the front side user can see the name and icon. On hover, each card flips and displays a picture either of locked or unlocked cloud storage with expansion text to the introduction on top and a button taking the user to containers listed as public or private depending on their choice
  - The third section are 4 attention-capturing white 3 cards with icon, title, and content communicating 4 key values that containers deliver. On hovering over each card, they move with animation upwards and change color to background black and text orange matching 2 large cards above
  - This page can be only seen by logged-in users

### Knowledge Posts List

  - Main dashboard and view of knowledge posts
  - It is built out of 3 components: PopularProfiles, Sidebar, and Post
  - On phone and tablet screen sizes, popular profiles are taking the top of the page under the navbar following the layout of other pages such as the profile page or one of the public/private containers list pages. The sidebar is hidden but can be activated as a modal if the user presses the compass icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. The rest are infinite scroll containers that fetches and display all posts that satisfy page criteria
  - On larger screens, the layout is slightly different. On the left side full-height column with a sidebar component taking a width of less than 1/3 of the screen while on the right side also less than 1/3 of the width of the screen is a list of all public profiles that occur on other pages like post detail, profile page, containers lists. In the middle taking slightly over 50% of the screen width is a list of all knowledge posts in the format of card one under another as an infinite scroll
  - On both screens above the posts list there is a search and sort bar allowing users to search contents based on: author, title, sub-title, post category, topic, and any words appearing in the content field. The sort bar allows displaying posts in a specific order by ascending or descending title, topic, post category, favorites count, likes count, comments count, containers count, data posted, and last updated.
  - Background is gray following the app styling rule allowing all components including the search bar to cut in sharp 
  into the background being white background and also making it seem like they are floating

### Knowledge Posts Details

  - Own a page where users can read more about the content and engage with the community
  The posts detail page is built as an extension of the posts list removing the sidebar component and other posts so the user can focus on one card at a time. PopularProfiles components behaves and is positioned identically as on other pages keeping consistency and offering user choice to find specific author on demand
  - On this page, post card has more space around it taking more than 50% of the screen on PC screen sizes to emphasize the more important part of the page than user profiles.
  - In addition, comment-related components are added below the post card allowing users to post a comment or view previously posted comments. If there are no comments yet, the user is encouraged to post one
  - Post card always have a title section on the top including the author's profile image and username on the left side, and if the author is a user themself, on the right side there is a three-dot icon that on click activates a dropdown for navigation to editing and deleting the post
  - Under the title bar there is either a placeholder image with a tree representing knowledge in the mystic environment or whichever post image the user uploads on edit form to be a card's cover image
  - Below the post image there is always larger than other text, the title is centered with a subtitle below if entered
  - As the categorization list is aligned left user can see the topic that the post belongs inside the black/orange badge, the post category to which it belongs, the location that it occurred, and when it was created and updated last.
  - Separately by divider next user can see a section with the main content of a post that is expandable so the user can read more about the post on the details page and all other pages where it occurs. If there is content, only three dots are written and content is not shown. Only the "Read more" button is shown which on click shows all the actual content and replaces its own name with "Collapse" on which it returns to the initial state creating expandable content user experience and interactive post card
  - Under the main content, the user can disclose any inspirations or knowledge sources
  - At the light gray footer of the post card there are 4 counters with orange icons and additional functionality. With the heart icon user can like/unlike any post that is not their own which if liked fills the entire heart with orange instead of only borders. The same for the favorites star icon which fills on input state as well, but in contrast to likes, it allows user to add their own posts to the list. Click on both icons refreshes the page in order to bring the user to the top of the page for navigation to liked or favorited posts. The other two icons count comments on posts and containers appended to without color changing. However, these two behave as links taking the user to the post details page to see comments or opening a modal on any page to show a list of all containers that it belongs to. On that list, if user hovers over any container their box icon opens up and if clicked takes the user to details on that container directly
  - It occurs on different pages and this component that defines how it will look on others

### Agile Development Team Report

In our Agile Development approach, we embraced the principles of Scrum, kanban, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Through iterative development, we broke down our project into manageable user stories, prioritizing and delivering them in short sprints. User involvement was key as we actively sought and incorporated feedback while conducting regular testing to ensure our features met user needs. With continuous integration and delivery, we seamlessly integrated code changes, ran manual tests, and deployed updates to production environments post-release during final master testing. Our adaptability shined as we embraced change, refactored code when needed, and maintained a positive innovative mindset throughout. Regular outsider retrospectives allowed us to reflect on our progress, identifying areas for improvement and implementing immediate changes. Transparency and accountability drove us as we tracked progress, every step taken and properly thought about with patience. Documentation was very important, enabling clarity and knowledge sharing through user stories. Finally, we adopted a culture of continuous learning, encouraging new skillset development, and taking extra steps to stay ahead of industry trends. Together, these events guide our Agile Development process, ensuring efficient, collaborative, and high-quality software delivery.

## DESIGN 

Per (client) request, the design strategy of pages and individual styling of components is merged into Existing Features in order to see both products simultaneously since the business information communication channel prefers one output for the board of directors.

- ### [Design Documentation](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Al8IOkY8-S-8gcU--qHCq0p5ue6RIQ?e=WdaHIw) 

## Design Approach

### Design Strategy
  - Focus of this version was deep design and architecture of the API connection between back-end and fron-end environments
  - There is where the most design has been implemented to ensure strong foundation for the next versions
  - In the second version, focus of design will shift towards the front-end visual details and advanced animations, transitions and effects

### Layout 
  - besides coloring separation, main website structure can be separated on pages below:
  - Home (index)
  - Register
  - Login
  - Support
  - Profile
  - Profile Edit
  - Knowl3dg3 Live List
  - Knowl3dg3 Details
  - Knowl3dg3 Followed
  - Knowl3dg3 Liked
  - Knowl3dg3 Favourite
  - Knowl3dg3 Create
  - Knowl3dg3 Edit
  - Containers Public List
  - Containers Private List
  - Containers Details
  - Containers Create
  - Conteiners Edit

### 4 Dimensions of Coloration:
  - Main colors - orange and black which complement and contrast each other well (structural coloring purpose)
    - black - navigational
    - orange - content-focused
  - Secondary colors - light gray and white are used as the separation between content and main colors (organizational coloring purpose)
  - The separation between main and secondary colors does a significant purpose to the project visually separating content type for the user due to a lot of options and visualizations
  - Every element has been colored with purpose and in consideration of all other elements

  ![Color Schema](./assets/media/images/colors/colors.jpg)

### Media
  - Custom Media - Professional custom work for the most important visual aspect of navigation logo and footer icon
  - Imported Media - Stock images for profile and post

### Resposive design

  - 320px-767px - Mobile (vertical + landscape)
  - 767px-1024px - Tablet (vertical + landscape)
  - 1024px+ - PC (vertical + landscape)

### Key Questions Addressed:
  - How to solve users' problem of not getting enough exposure to their structured knowledge?

### Libraries, contexts and hooks:

- React-infinite-scroll-component
  - Introduced to replace traditional pagination with loading instead of pagination
- React-bootstrap:
  - Introduced to speed up the development process and apply styling through HTML classes where beneficial
- Contexts:
  - CurrentUserContext exposes the user state to the entire app. Relevant components can subscribe to its changes
  - ProfileDataContext exposes the profile state to the entire app. Enables the PopularProfiles component to be in sync with the ProfilePage contents
- Custom hooks written to reduce repeatable state logic:
  - useClickOutsideToggle: enable toggle on the dropdown menu
  - useRedirect: enable redirect for users who are either logged in or logged out, depending on the use case
- Axios
  - popular library for making HTTP requests from front-end to back-end
- React-dropdown-select
  - library for creating feature-rich dropdowns. It provides various customization options and can be a helpful addition to create interactive and user-friendly forms or UI elements that involve selecting from a list of options.

### Development exception

Docstrings have been excluded from the final public version in order to protect development progress from the client's competition being a required non-private repository. The development team made a decision to protect important information and the client's strategy. Since only one developer is creating the first version, once the team expands with specialists and juniors in the v2.0, most definitely will be included internally in the controlled safe environment for cross-collaboration.

### Manual Testing

I have conducted infinite hours of testing across all screen sizes, devices and different browsers to conclude that now the site works well and all discussed features are included as intended. Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on large PC monitors, average laptops, tablets, and various mobile devices all in different screen sizes with minimum width of 320px for older devices. The website was given to friends and family to test out the website representing different types of users and their browsing styles next to personal backgrounds. All content is readable and understandable styled with good contrasting colors that also visually create a good combination. There is no visual bugs or errors after extensive testing. Automatic testing has been left until version 2.0 when it will be of use for specific new features that will benefit of it. For current project structure and endless hours of manual testing it does not make significant contribution since everything has been already validated. In addition, all user stories have been tested as pass while presenting functionalities to client. 

Testing has been done twice, one time pre-deployment and one time post-deployment assuring matching versions. In pre-deployment testing everything was more tested for errors, changes on screen also change database, and random letters with random letters lenght to make sure app renders good on all screens no matter the input. In post-deployment testing, every single feature has been tested with strict criteria for responsiveness. Entire website, every input field, every element and button were tested with correct and incorrect inputs in the both environments

##### CONCLUSION:

## BUGS

__Unsolved Bugs__

- All bugs were solved that were caused by created code
- There were no significant bugs in the development process
- Mostly it was learning curve of new framework so every step of the code there was an error that was solved with learning, persistance and effort
- Sources of knowledge are included below.
- Once fully understood, everything made sense and it was easy to create entire website without distractions and bugs
- What could be qualified as bug are console errors that have no impact on the code and scripts that too complex to solve at the moment

- Unsolved bug not due to created code:
  - dj-rest-auth
    - Does not allow users to logout
    - Issue is that the same site attribute we set to ‘None’ in settings.py (JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None') is not passed to the logout view
    - This means that we can’t log out, but must wait for the refresh token to expire instead
    - Potential solution:
      - Create own logout view in V2.0
      - Set both cookies to an empty string and pass additional attributes like secure, httponly and samesite, which was left out by mistake by the library

## CREDITS 

### Content, Knowledge and Code
  
- All content and code are 100% unique and custom-made per request for a client in order to prevent any legal issues in the future and to provide full control over an optimized experience

- All content, concepts, and visuals have been exclusively created for this site and to solve specific problem for any user without any external inspiration

- Code structure is also 100% original and completely created by a developer. A developer has followed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Advanced Front-End courses at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/) where theory on building blocks has been taught. After reading through knowledge materials to see what are possibilities of creating this site are, general blocks have been put together separately to create original work. Given completed examples have not been plagiarized but served as a general guide. Finally, the README structure has been used by Code Institute's template and example in this project in order to be created under industry standards and expectations. A general back-end and fron-end template for repository created for students before commencing their project for convenience has been imported before the first coding lines. Project requirements have been used as secondary rough guidelines for the content structure. Consultations with Student Care, Tutors, and Personal Mentor Ronan were provided by them as well which was crucial in this project creation by providing support, motivation, and any mistakes indications and guidance to own problem-solving. Code Institute, therefore can be referenced also as the main knowledge source tool along their lecture projects.

- All debugging and problem-solving has been done strictly by the developer trying different combinations with known and unknown elements and attributes. No external sources and no professional help just Code Institute's tutors for elaboration on theory and advices dealing with complex problems
